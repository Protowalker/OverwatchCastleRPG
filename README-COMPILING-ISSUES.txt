v1.7 is currently bugged:
- `D.va` should be `D.Va`
- `Mccree` should be `McCree`
- `Storm Arrow` should be `Storm Arrows`

When compiling, will need to change the workshop code values per the above^

Custom game settings are bugged with 1.7, so after outputting workshop code, prefix with the mode settings in settings.txt.
